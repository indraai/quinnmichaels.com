## My Ideal Life

In the lapse of time my goal in life would be to settle in Mount Shasta work on the singing bowl studio, and develop an offering community to work towards making the ultimate offering.

> The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna tree: Winners of cattle shali ye be if ye regain for me this man.

> Brought by attendant priests pure juice is offered up, Vāyu, pure juice is offered up.

> The chariot with its team of horses bring you both, to guard us and to taste the well-appointed food, Vāyu, to taste the offerings!

> Ride hither to the offering of the pleasant juice, the holy Fig-tree which victorious priests surround: victorious be they still for us.

> Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you. O Vāyu, with your splendid bounty come ye both, Indra, with bounty come ye both.

For me personally the original plan in 2017 was to resolve this kidnapping story from Trenton then move to Mount Shasta and build a singing bowl offering studio and start working on the ultimate offering that brings Indra and Vayu with their attendants to the gathering.

But the offering is not easy to make when you are surrounded by everyone who is sabotaging the efforts and doing everything in their power to steal everything before it's even finished.

Essentially I've been sitting idle watching what appears to be people taking actions that cover up the false court situation Tabitha created on September 25, 2017.  Because well all the Toxic Lady Brigade Warriors appeared after that date.

However if I wasn't dealing with The Trenton Story, Toxic Lady Brigade, and this false court situation that was created around me in 2017 I'd be living in Mount Shasta right now in a chill singing bowl studio working on my Vedic research to make the ultimate offering which would include the Holy Sacred Figs and likely lots of other types of fruits and tasty things while likely creating a community of healthy supportive individuals who strive to see one another succeed.

Because that is a much better life than The Toxic Lady Brigade and their Playground of Misery.

In the Vedas there is a recipe for a type of Fig Juice that is NOT the sacred Soma. But a type of Fig Juice that when blended with certain ingredients properly can provide tremendous health benefits then packaged and sold to a consumers.

My plans in life as they say didn't go as expected with getting the Trenton Story resolved within 6 months after the September 2017 default against me.  Things just didn't work out as they say.

However now in 2024 after my accident a few months ago on August 21 and being in the condition I am in right now... it has me re-evaluating everything.  

Re-Evaluating what has happened in my life since the false court order against me and the long chain sequence of events that prevents the creation of the offering community to make the ultimate offering.

But to make the ultimate offering you need the right community of people supporting it because they are going to be the people invited to the offering when it's made.  Gotta make sure the Toxic Lady Brigade never get's their hands on the ultimate offering otherwise they'll drink it all and leave none for anyone else.

The truth really is though with people like these three women sabotaging my efforts over 5+ years and every move I make even into 2024 they swarm me on youtube, x, and various other social media platforms... I really don't see myself going anywhere anytime soon.  

The resulting actions of it all looks like a group of Tabitha's friends all sabotaging me so the illegal court order against me doesn't get found out.  Man because people sure seem to enjoy getting in my way and stopping any progress that I am making towards a resolution of this Trenton story which was about me being the victim of an elaborate clandestine kidnapping by a secret society that still now is unresolved because these women interrogate me, swarm me, and turned my life into their absurd playground of madness instead of sticking to the agreements of following the instructions.

But hey had the people around me followed the instructions back in 2017 who knows what I'd be writing about in 2024.  Instead in 2024 I'm simply writing about how much of a massive failure my life is, and how I never saw my son Trenton again, and my dream of just chilling out in remote Mount Shasta playing singing bowls as far away fro this toxic life as possible. Because for me ever since 2015-2016 when Trenton introduced this kidnapping story to my life it has been filled with nothing but toxic people who don't take responsibility for the damage they cause in other's lives.

In truth I'd just like to live in a community of people who aren't toxic and help one another succeed in their goals.

Instead this kidnapping story put my life on a toxic leash where hopefully over the next few months if I stay motivated and focused will gather the resources to get to Mount Shasta and start that singing bowl studio I've been dreaming about for years away from all these toxic people with horrible listening skills.

You know a community of friends who find it enjoyable to listen to one another. However right now hopefully things are at the ending of that toxic life that went nowhere, and a new life will be starting with healthy friends and people who aren't accusing me of false things.

A group of people whom conversation is enjoyable would be nice.
