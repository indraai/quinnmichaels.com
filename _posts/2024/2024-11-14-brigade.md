Welcome to today's post... as you can see lately I've been updating the site to be more elegant and refined.  As for the lat 5+ years I haven't really been developing websites. Mostly dealing with being the victim of some elaborate clandestine kidnapping that nobody wants to talk about.

 It sounds strange I know... yeah yeah yeah.  It's been 5+ years so I know what's likely going through your mind.  Disbelief, deception, self-interest, and all those incorrect thoughts you may be having right now.

If you look at the X thread around the hashtag #QuinnMichaels before the website went online it's really easy to see.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What happened to me last night <a href="https://t.co/1Psn7raatL">pic.twitter.com/1Psn7raatL</a></p>&mdash; Quinn Michaels (@quinnmichaels) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinnmichaels/status/1826218649277124608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

You could say I had my experience of it on August 21, 2024 at 4:23 am after getting in a serious accident late one night. You can see what I looked like right after I made my way home somehow in the middle of the night.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

After this video was taken the next day an ambulance came and picked me up and took me to the hospital where I ended up in the intensive care unit with a skull fracture, broken clavicle, fractured shoulder blade, 8 fractured ribs, broken toe, and a few other injuries. The doctor in the hospital said I was broken and had to have surgery to repair my clavicle, and still when writing this my right arm is non-functional and I'm still healing from all the injuries.

After this it started really showing me something about the people around me.

**Imagine it this way...**
I'm laying there in the ICU with nobody to call and nobody on my emergency contact list only with a non-working iPhone that's connected over the hospital wi-fi posting to X from a hospital bed while The Toxic Lady Brigade attacks and torments me to get details for their lately romance novels.

So there I was totally alone in the hospital bed on some pretty serious pain medication while these strange women over X tormented me and they even did a stream about me while I was in the hospital without my consent.

Then you could say I got so frustrated in the hospital with everything going on that I finally kinda forced them discharge me when really I should have spent another day or two in the hospital just for observation. At this point neither here nor there.

So I get home from the hospital with my right arm in a sling and no car then have to figure out how to get food, and well start ordering pizza because at this time not only do I not have a car to get around in, but also I do not have a phone to call and order food or use delivery services.

Then I remembered I had an old Amazon account, and signed up for Amazon Prime again and had them deliver me some supplies like a wedge pillow and lidocaine patches for my shoulder. Being someone that doesn't have a friends and family network using Amazon Prime same day delivery on medical supplies was a life saver at the time.

While all this is going on I'm continuing to stream on Youtube about some this crazy kidnapping story my son Trenton told me in 2015-2016 that lead me to getting stuck in these nasty Area 51 simulations surrounded by Russian Spies type business.

However the most difficult party at this time is these band of women I have labeled The Toxic Lady Brigade who have taken my life and turned it into their playground.

## September 2017

But you could say I got trapped in all this from many anchors, but the main one of having to do these Tyler instructions to get to the truth of The Trenton Story was because Trenton's mother Tabitha in 2017 manipulated the situation to where I defaulted on a court case and she was able to secure full custody of Trenton and secure a fraudulent restraining order preventing me from contacting him.

![Tabitha Lawyer Documents Facebook Message](/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/facebook-lawyer-message.jpg "The message Tabitha's lawyer sent Quinn Michaels over Facebook in 2017")
> The above screenshot shows the message from Tabitha's lawyer sent to Quinn Michaels over Facebook containing the court documents that would prevent Quinn from ever seeing his son Trenton Lavery again.

![Tabitha Court Papers](/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/tabitha-court-papers.jpg "The court papers sent to Quinn Michaels over Facebook")
> September 15, 2017 Tabitha's lawyer sent Quinn Michaels documents over Facebook that weren't court certified letting him know that in 10 days he was going to default on his case and lose rights to his son Trenton Lavery where also a restraining order was issued preventing future contact.

![Tabitha Court Service](/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/tabitha-court-service.jpg "The court papers served to Quinn Michaels over Facebook")
> The second page of the document that shows even though based on past communications Tabitha and her lawyer both had Quinn's email and phone number to contact him, but conveniently omitted it from the court case to make it appear as though Quinn was unreachable but contact was attempted. It also states they emailed the documents, but there is no email address listed in the documents. When both Tabitha and her lawyers had at previous times communicated with Quinn through his gmail address directly.

At the time when these documents arrived in September 2017 after that I figured that putting together a group of people to follow the Tyler instructions and get the evidence to the truth to the story was the only way I was ever going to see my son Trenton Lavery again after these court documents pretty much stopped me from getting within 1000 yards of him.

As they say Tabitha had the lawyers, friends, and resources.  Quinn Michaels at the time was living out of his car in the forest of Mount Shasta trying to get his life together.  However anyone who was around me at the time knows that after these documents came in I left Mount Shasta shortly after and started the Team Tyler project to follow the instructions and locate the truth to the story Trenton had told me that resulted in the situation manifesting.

To be continued... (I'm working on this as a live blog, an will be updating it in real time.)
