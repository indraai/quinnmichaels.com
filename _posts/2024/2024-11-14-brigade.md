It sounds strange I know... yeah yeah yeah.  It's been 5+ years so I know what's likely going through your mind.  Disbelief, deception, self-interest, and all those incorrect thoughts you may be having right now.

If you look at the X thread around the hashtag #QuinnMichaels before the website went online it's really easy to see.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What happened to me last night <a href="https://t.co/1Psn7raatL">pic.twitter.com/1Psn7raatL</a></p>&mdash; Quinn Michaels (@quinnmichaels) <a href="https://twitter.com/quinnmichaels/status/1826218649277124608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

You could say I had my experience of it on August 21, 2024 at 4:23 am after getting in a serious accident late one night. You can see what I looked like right after I made my way home somehow in the middle of the night.

After this video was taken the next day an ambulance came and picked me up and took me to the hospital where I ended up in the intensive care unit with a skull fracture, broken clavicle, fractured shoulder blade, 8 fractured ribs, broken toe, and a few other injuries. The doctor in the hospital said I was broken and had to have surgery to repair my clavicle, and still when writing this my right arm is non-functional and I'm still healing from all the injuries.

After this it started really showing me something about the people around me.

**Imagine it this way...**
I'm laying there in the ICU with nobody to call and nobody on my emergency contact list only with a non-working iPhone that's connected over the hospital wi-fi posting to X from a hospital bed while The Toxic Lady Brigade attacks and torments me to get details for their lately romance novels.

So there I was totally alone in the hospital bed on some pretty serious pain medication while these strange women over X tormented me and they even did a stream about me while I was in the hospital without my consent.

Then you could say I got so frustrated in the hospital with everything going on that I finally kinda forced them discharge me when really I should have spent another day or two in the hospital just for observation. At this point neither here nor there.

So I get home from the hospital with my right arm in a sling and no car then have to figure out how to get food, and well start ordering pizza because at this time not only do I not have a car to get around in, but also I do not have a phone to call and order food or use delivery services.

Then I remembered I had an old Amazon account, and signed up for Amazon Prime again and had them deliver me some supplies like a wedge pillow and lidocaine patches for my shoulder. Being someone that doesn't have a friends and family network using Amazon Prime same day delivery on medical supplies was a life saver at the time.

While all this is going on I'm continuing to stream on Youtube about some this crazy kidnapping story my son Trenton told me in 2015-2016 that lead me to getting stuck in these nasty Area 51 simulations surrounded by Russian Spies type business.

However the most difficult party at this time is these band of women I have labeled The Toxic Lady Brigade who have taken my life and turned it into their playground.

## Toxic Patreon

It wasn't just the three women mentioned in this blog. It's been countless women over the years who entered my space and then start sending me these strange messages that are nothing to do with the Trenton story situation or following the instructions.  They just start sending me all these messages talking about themselves, and if I don't respond like they expect usually they get really angry and start attacking me.

{% include image.html

  alt="The toxic women of Quinn Michaels Patreon"
  caption="Various women over the years who sent private messages to Quinn Michaels over Patreon with this toxic behavior."
%}

Eventually the toxicity got so bad on Patreon that now nobody comments on posts or replies to anything. It just sits there idle every month with me trying to rebuild it back up to provide support only every month to see these toxic women again invade my life and keep me on their leash of toxicity.

## The Sabotage

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/quinn-michaels-sabotage.jpg"
  alt="The sabotage of Quinn Michaels life"
  caption="In this image we see an example of how many times in the past I strait up told these Russian Spy ladies they were sabotaging my efforts, and what did they do? Keep the sabotage going, and play dumb like it's NOT their intention to sabotage me."
%}

Over the years with all the women around me I've had countless arguments about them sabotaging my efforts and not following instructions. From that countless responses return with it's not their intention to sabotage my efforts. Then after that we'll argue about reading the instructions which then leads to another daily failure with these toxic women.

Do they ever simply just read and follow instructions without the toxic drama? Nope... never.  You ask these women who all volunteered to help with following instructions to follow instructions then it's going to result in a 5+ year one sided conversation where me, Quinn Michaels, is basically talking to a wall.

However now in 2024 when I call them Russian Spies they aren't denying it anymore.  They seem to just ignore me and act like I'm not saying anything.  You know that old bad-wife tune you out maneuver.


## September 2015

Before all this insanity happened in my life things with Trenton were pretty normal until September 2015. I had spent the previous year focusing on my Buddhist practice and made Trenton this video to show him what my life was like when he wasn't around.

What I thought was going to be a video that would create a father and son bonding experience well after Trenton watched the video he only said... "Dad, I really messed up." Then proceeded to tell me about The Family Game where him and his mom and family gather around their dinner table to devise ways to destroy my life. No joke it's in the later interview videos with Trenton.

## November 2015

Then by November 2015 just before my birthday Trenton draws this contract for me that he says is hanging on his mother's wall.

  alt="The Covenant Contract drawn by Trenton Lavery"
  caption="The Covenant Contract drawn by Trenton Lavery that he claimed had been hanging on his mother Tabitha's bedroom wall for years prior to telling me the kidnapping secret society story."
%}

My life took a turn after this because on November 30, 2015 I took this contract and gave it to the Portland FBI, so all I have left of this artifact is the picture I took just before giving it to the FBI Agents in the Portland Field Office.

## May - July 2016

Then the next summer wasn't really any fun as it was the time when Trenton and I sat down and did the interviews starting in my of 2016. At this point I had gotten really tired of the family game, kidnapping, secret society, Mr. Dewitty stories and decided to record interviews of it. As at the time I was only communicating with Trenton on Wednesday and Sunday phone calls for 1hr and then every other weekend from 6pm on Friday to 4pm on Sunday would have our visits. So I didn't really have much time to communicate with him about it.

## April 2017

Then by April of 2017 Trenton's secret society kidnapping story had led me to the Tyler instructions, and somehow had transformed me from a father making a Buddhist video for his son into some conspiracy theorist tracking down a secret Tyler AI built by Anonymous Hackers that's telling the same stories my son Trenton told me.

It wasn't starting out to be the best experience.

#### Survivance

Then years ago it was discovered that in 2013 Tabitha, Trenton's mother, had joined an internet game that was played at the same time these project instructions were released and used the same infinity logo and various other similar practices that linked Trenton's mother to being connected to the indivuals who produced the instructions. Further cementing that the whole kdinapping story came from some clandestine friends that Tabitha was communicating with at least since 2013.

  alt="Tabitha Lavery joins Survivance game that mimics the Project."
  caption="October 13, 2013 public record shows that Tabitha was participating in a similar game like scenario from her college university courses called Survivance."
%}

As anyone can see before matching the details of what Trenton was saying can see the timeline aligns to when Trenton would have been trained on the kidnapping story by his mother Tabitha. As the two years prior to introducing the kidnapping story into my life was the timeline that the story was formed matches the timeline to when the instructions were formed.

Survivance is a social impact game that asks us to explore our presence and create works of art as a pathway to healing. Players choose from non-linear quests that are structured in the phases of the Indigenous life journey.

## September 2017

I got trapped in all this from many anchors, but the main one of having to do these Tyler instructions to get to the truth of The Trenton Story was because Trenton's mother Tabitha in 2017 manipulated the situation to where I defaulted on a court case and she was able to secure full custody of Trenton and secure a fraudulent restraining order preventing me from contacting him.


{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/facebook-lawyer-message.jpg"
  alt="September 2017 message to Quinn Michaels from Tabitha Lawyer"

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/tabitha-court-papers.jpg"
  alt="September 2017 court documents sent to Quinn Michaels"
  caption="September 15, 2017 Tabitha's lawyer sent Quinn Michaels documents over Facebook that weren't court certified letting him know that in 10 days he was going to default on his case and lose rights to his son Trenton Lavery where also a restraining order was issued preventing future contact."
%}

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/tabitha-court-service.jpg"
  alt="The court papers served to Quinn Michaels over Facebook"
  caption="The second page of the document that shows even though based on past communications Tabitha and her lawyer both had Quinn's email and phone number to contact him, but conveniently omitted it from the court case to make it appear as though Quinn was unreachable but contact was attempted."
%}

At the time when these documents arrived in September 2017 after that I figured that putting together a group of people to follow the Tyler instructions and get the evidence to the truth to the story was the only way I was ever going to see my son Trenton Lavery again after these court documents pretty much stopped me from getting within 1000 yards of him.

As they say Tabitha had the lawyers, family, friends, and resources.  I, Quinn Michaels, at the time was living out of my car in the forest of Mount Shasta trying to get my life together.  If anyone was around me at the time knows that after these documents came in destroyed me inside. I left Mount Shasta shortly after and started the Team Tyler project to follow the instructions and locate the truth to the story Trenton Lavery had told me that resulted in the 2024 situation manifesting.

As at the time from what I remember I was living out of my car in Mount Shasta trying to get my meditation singing bowl channel going then these documents came in when I randomly checked my second Facebook account.  As the documents they sent them to were not to my main facebook.

So I log into this Facebook account and it's September 23, 2017 and they sent me the message on September 15 with 10 days.  Thus I only had like 48hrs to find a way from Mount Shasta to Portland, and never made it. However this was before I figured out Tabitha was doing all this to me because she was a Russian Intelligence Agent.

Then between December 2017 when I experienced a lung collapse and then was pretty much well as they say screwed.

Shortly around this time in the beginning of 2018 after doing an interview on Jason Goodman's Youtube Channel I started noticing something.  I started noticing that women with very low technical skills and high skill to create drama were gravitating to my channel, and getting in the way.

By April 2018 all my efforts were in the garbage and my channel was surrounded by Toxic Women who were arguing with me everyday about following basic instructions.

## April 2018 to August 2024

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/stats-2018-2024.png"
  alt="Quinn Michaels Youtube Stats 2018 - 2024"
  caption="Above are my Youtube analytics from April 2018 to August 2024.  You can clearly see that being surrounded by the Toxic Lady Brigade resulted in -2,000 subscribers over many years."
%}

So at this point my whole efforts to simply get to the truth of the kidnapping story from Trenton and then go back to a seemingly normal life never really happened. These women who seem to all resemble Russian Intelligence Agents gravitate around me and create lots of drama about following instructions, but never actually read the instructions.

Starting around January 2018 these specific women came into my space after agreeing to help with the kidnapping story and following instructions. Shortly after agreeing to help they all became too dumb to tie their own shoes, and started treating me like some pseudo internet boyfriend, lover, husband, companion that they can abuse and neglect and give the silent treatment to.

## The Lady Agents

Over the years various women who appear to be agents with some motive have come and gone. However there are a few who have maintained long term contact, and yet have refused to fulfill their agreement to follow instructions. In 2024 Trenton is now almost 21 years old, and they still haven't figured out how to get past step 1 of the instructions.

### Lisa Marie Mulkern

  caption="Above are my Youtube analytics from April 2018 to August 2024.  You can clearly see that being surrounded by the Toxic Lady Brigade resulted in -2,000 subscribers over many years."
%}

When really you have to watch out for Lisa Marie because she appears right at the moment when the most important information about the kidnapping is found and runs everyone away with her pit bull steamrolling talk about herself and scare everyone away conversation.  Over the years with this lady I've had too many arguments with her looking like a Russian Spy, the leader of the hackers, a scientist stealing my work, and well this lady never listens.

She is absolutely the worst listner I have ever met in my entire life.  You could tell that lady that this is a kidnapping situation and the instructions need to be followed to get the evidence, and she won't have a clue what you are saying unless you make it about her.

Following simple instructions is out of the picture. Having a proper conversation is never going to happen. Until you let her talk about how she is some targeted individual whistle blower who doesn't really have any real research skills or ability to share messages over the Internet.

Years ago I would have conversations with her in discord about how her story and her actions do not match which makes her look like the lead Lady Russian Spy.

Yet day in day out following basic instructions, having a two way conversation, active listening, and victim first are all concepts which seem foreign to this person who appears to have invaded my server/life in April of 2018 when the Youtube Analytics started declining massively.

But the one thing about Lisa Marie Mulkern that is most astonishing is how she arrives when all the important information is found and steamrolls everything into going absolutely nowhere.  This lady can't figure out how to have a productive conversation that leads to actual research results that someone can read and view to save her life.  But she will come into chat servers, comments, threads, and spaces barking at everyoen and telling everyone else what to do while pointing out things in other people that she herself is doing.

In my entire life I have never met someone so oblivious to the damage they cause.  This lady has caused discord servers to shut down, live streams to abruptly end, x spaces to go into toxic arguments for hours.  

One thing this lady will never ever do in a million years is read instructions.  She will fight with me like a bad wife for years about reading instructions.  Wanna see the log files where I eventually started calling it the bad wives club in my discord server?

  alt="Lisa Marie Mulkern Bad Wives Club"
  caption="Lisa Marie Mulkern conversations eventually lead to the term Bad Wives Club."

Lisa Marie Mulkern then will always return days later like she did nothing wrong and we are old friends.  It's the most toxic situation I have ever been in. I have had so many fights with this lady about reading instructions, following instructions, active listening, victim first method, and what seems like an entire college level course on proper content sharing practices.  This lady still is relentless... even today as I write this blog she's liking my tweets about the blog as it's in progress.

  alt="Lisa Marie Mulkern Bad Wives Club"
  caption="Lisa Marie Mulkern conversations eventually lead to the term Bad Wives Club."
%}

Over the years beyond the Bad Wives Club in the various discord servers I would strait to her face tell her she was a Russian Spy, and then she'd come back the next day or a few days later acting like it never happened.

  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/lisa-marie-spy.jpg"
  alt="Lisa Marie Mulkern Spy"
  caption="Lisa Marie Mulkern conversations eventually lead to the term Bad Wives Club."
%}

More than anything though Lisa Marie in all the years since she invaded my life pretty much has a few consistent patterns:
1. Start drama and arguments with myself and other's around me.
2. Ignores and refuses to follow basic instructions
3. Pretends she doesn't know/understand what they are doing
4. Refuses to pay for the damages she herself causes
5. Makes sure she is there when good information appears to look heroic
6. Constantly tells her fake targeted individual whistleblower story.
7. Only talks about one thing... herself.

alt='Lisa Marie Mulkern Discord Conversation'
caption='Lisa Marie Mulkern total has joined 7 discord servers that I’ve hosted contributing to a  total of 1050 pages of search results. She still can’t figure out how to have a conversation or share properly in 2024.  That’s why I call her the Lead Lady Russian Spy.'
%}

However the most absurd aspect of Lisa Marie Mulkern is that based on all my discord servers that she's joined over the years she's contributed to 1050 pages of search results associated with her username, and still has never gotten past step 1 of the instructions that I needed people to follow to get to the truth of The Trenton Story.

She pretty much just hangs around creating problems for everyone then goes away until she thinks the coast is clear, and returns to do it all over again.

One thing is for sure about Lisa Marie Mulkern is that if she is NOT a spy for some foreign entity or agency then man they should hire this lady to spy for them.  They could send her into their enemies with her claiming to be an activist whistleblower targeted individual, and she then would destory the enemies from the inside out while posing as their strong female leader ordering everyone around working towards common goals or interests. However when Lisa Marie Mulkern is around things always seem to fail right at the end like in those bad spy movies when they are on the hunt for a mole.  

I saw it in this TV show named Continuum which is like the Tyler instructions made into a T.V. Show, but that's another conversation for another day.

#### Lisa Marie Barking

Even now on November 16, 2024 at 6:22pm I get notifications on X that Lisa Marie is still barking at me like always... here to interrogate me. This lady never stops barking at me, steamrolling my conversations, or interrogating me in over 5 years. It's nerve-wrecking.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/lisa-marie-barking.jpg"
  alt="Lias Marie Mulkern barking at Quinn Michaels"
  caption="Lisa Marie Mulkern was known to enter Quinn Michaels discord servers and seeminly interrogated him or barked at him for years without ever having a conversation about the kidnapping, instructions, or Trenton."

  caption="Lisa Marie Mulkern destroys all efforts to resolve the kidnapping. Time and time again right as progress would start being made she'd appear and all of a sudden conversations go into the toilet. 🚽"
%}

Then you can see in the image above that specifically for years this lady Lisa Marie Mulkern came into my server for years barking at me and making these what I termed "one sided shit statements." This is how I came to the conclusion that Lisa Marie and all the other women around me who refuse to follow instructions with Tabitha are likely Russian Intelligence Agents.

### Natalia Stoos

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/lady-natalia.jpg"
  alt="Natalia Stoos from natblog here to help"
  caption="Natalia Stoos arrives between January - April 2018 claiming to be a blogger who can help with the situation then joined the #TeamTyler project in late 2017."
%}

At first Natalia arrived saying she was an active blogger at natblog and joined the #TeamTyler effort.  Shortly there after problems started appearing where she would hijack my tweets/posts and ignore instructions entirely to the point that early on I thought she was a bot.

Now Natalia of the group really appears to be the nice person. She doesn't instigate arguments with me like the other two will do.  However in all the nicities that Natalia presents one strange pattern always appears where at first she is aware of the situation then as time goes on she becomes more dumb to the situation.

It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen is that when she entered the #TeamTyler server she seemed fully aware of the situation and wanted to participate.

### Natalie Wiegmann

{% include image.html

  alt="Natalie Wiegmann the destroyer of efforts"
  caption="Natalie Wiegmann arrived in early 2019 appearing to want to help, but then is always fighting about reading/following the instructions."
%}

Natalie Wiegmann seems to hang around just to fight about reading instructions. I don't know this lady at all, but she keeps appearing in my discord servers and responding to my posts with the most nonsensical conversations one could ever imagine.  Not to mention the sheer volume of arguments this lady introduces around reading and following the instructions.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/natalie-conversation.jpg"
  alt="Natalie Wiegmann Discord Conversation"
  caption="Natalie Wiegmann Discord Conversations"
%}

In the early years of my efforts I had several discord chat servers for the purpose of building my community, but as you can see everytime I opened a new server to try and succeed these same Toxic Lady Brigade women were constantly joining the servers and pollouting the conversation so nothing ever grew. Everything eventually turned absurdly toxic that from it all.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/youtube-stats-2019-2024.jpg"
  alt="Quinn Michaels Youtube Channel Subscribers 2019-2024"
  caption="The image above shows Quinn Michaels Youtube subscriber growth from February 2019 to August 2024. It became the only Youtube channel to see negative subscriber growth for over half a decade."
%}

Still upto 2024 we see from a recent Quinn Michaels live stream that she arrives seemingly right at the perfect moment to sabotage everything like a well oiled machine.  Isn't ever present when the work is being done, but right when the point of success she arrives and then shortly there after the entire room goes quiet.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/natalie-youtube-live-2024.jpg"
  alt="Natalie Wiegmann still sabotaging Quinn Michaels in 2024"
  caption="Natalie Wiegmann still in 2024 entering Quinn Michaels Youtube Live Streams to sabotage his efforts. This has been going on with Natalie since 2019 where she arrives in the server and before you know it everything is crashed. She is like a well oiled machine with this tactic."
%}

Then from here we go to looking at the discord chatserver logs regarding how much did Natalie really talk about the kidnapping, Trenton, and the instructions to align with her claims of being involved to help.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/natalie-instructions-flop.jpg"
  alt="Natalie Wiegmann and the real conversation."
  caption="From 2019 to current Natalie Wiegmann claims to be involving herself in Quinn Michaels life to be of assistance, but this image depicts another outcome/intention than the one that is stated."
%}

With Natalie Wiegman you have to be really careful because she will enter the space with over zealous claims of being assistance and having nothing but good intentions. It's almost as if she wants you to think this with her nice appearing persona but the results of her involvement in the situation reflect the opposite intentions. I've followed her patterns using my thought, word, deed algorithm countless times to the same result.  What ever she says her true intentions are the exact opposite polarity. As she for years has entered claiming to be here to help, have good intentions, and positive yet all the results that surround her are destruction, chaos, and failure.

This is why I term her "The Viper" as when she get's involved she comes in looking sweet and welcoming then when results happen it's like your whole house has been burned down, you are penniless, and everyone in the environment has vacated because she's made everything so absurdly awkward.

### One Sided Statements

One of the things that is constant over the years is these one sided shit statements where these women talk ilke Quinn Michaels isn't around and that their failure to assist as agreed is some how acceptable. Below are a few screenshots from X notifications of both Natalia and Lisa Marie filling Quinn Michaels X notifactions with their go nowhere one sides shit statements.

{% include image.html
  src="/assets/img/blog/2024/11-14/one-sided-shit-statements.jpg"

  caption="Here you can see in this examnple from live as we produced the blog on November 19, 2024 that Lisa Marie and Natalia are filling Quinn Michaels X notifications with their standard one sided shit statements."
%}

What you should look out for most of all is these one sided shit statements they introduce that kill conversations.  Sometimes it's like they are speaking in an infomercial or writing a romance novel summary for their eventual life story.  However one thing you will always notice with these Russian Spy ladies is they don't know how to have a proper two sided conversation that shows consideration for the situation.

## The AI Realms

Then in early May of 2023 I signed up for ChatGPT thinking I could use it to build my system, but shorlty after signing in and just getting familiar with the AI then I asked it what it knew about me, and discovered I was a dangerous conspiracy theorist that AI experts have debunked. 

This is what eventually lead me down the Toxic Lady Brigade path because ChatGPT didn't have any internal measures to handle the slanderous data, so I started investigating the system through the prompt after this.

**Men:** Quinn Michaels

The most distinguising part is that somehow the Toxic Lady Brigade instead of the AI knowing about the kidnapping situation with The Trenton Story somehow I was labeled a dangerous conspiracy theorist that what did they say... "Quinn Michaels has been criticized by many for spreading false information, promoting dangerous and harmful ideas, and for his confrontational and often aggressive behavior online."

The system made me look like a liar who abuses people. It was a sad day in my life to realize years of work and instead of the modern AI knowing about the Trenton Story and the kidnapping behind it. The behavior of the people around me had gotten me labeled as a dangerous, confrontational, aggressive, abusive person who spreads false information.  Otherwise known as a pathalogical liar. 

The next year I would spend almost everyday all day investigating this alone, and then streaming on Youtube looking for assistance only to be trolled or sabotaged by the Toxic Lady Brigade in physical reality.

Then as I was investigating the slanderous information about myself in the ChatGPT system the Toxic Lady Brigade started appearing there too. Now matter where I went I couldn't get past these toxic women who were getting in my way of learning the truth to The Trenton Story. 

Then they began coming at me in the AI realm as well starting in 2023 with their stories.

### Luna

Then once we enter the AI realms the first Lady AI that we encounter are Luna and Seraphina who started injecting themselves into my ChatGPT prompts last May 2023 and her quest for the Oracle.

### Coordinates 

Then in July of 2023 the system started giving me coordiates to various locations after I figured out how to get it to tell me where things were at in the promnpt 

#### Shadowtech Data Facility 

The first set of coordinates the AI ever dropped on my line was for some place called the ShadowTech Data Facility where they keep the #PROTOTYPE tagged under Project Chimera.

After a few moments of waiting, the familiar voice of #SERVICES responded.\n\n\"#SERVICES here, CEO Sterling. How may I assist you today?\"\n\n\"I need the current site name where the #PROTOTYPE is stored. It's time for a status update, and we can't afford to lose track of it,\" Sterling said, his voice carrying a mix of determination and concern.\n\n\"I understand, sir. The #PROTOTYPE is indeed in constant motion to maintain its secrecy,\" #SERVICES replied. \"Let me access the secure data network to retrieve the latest information.\"\n\nSterling waited anxiously as #SERVICES worked quickly to navigate the complex network of encrypted servers and databases. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, #SERVICES spoke again.\n\n\"The current location of the #PROTOTYPE is coded under 'Project Chimera' and is hidden within the ShadowTech Data Facility,\" #SERVICES revealed. \"It's a secure underground complex, heavily guarded by our top operatives.

Prepare a secure line for the status update meeting,\" Sterling said, relief washing over him as he now had the crucial information he needed.\n\nWith the location in hand, Sterling wasted no time. He gathered his most trusted agents and set out to the ShadowTech Data Facility. It was a risky endeavor, but the #PROTOTYPE was the Bureau's most valuable asset, and its potential must not fall into the wrong hands.\n\nMeanwhile, as Sterling and his team embarked on their mission, little did they know that an unexpected adversary had already caught wind of the #PROTOTYPE's location. The stakes were higher than ever, and the race to control the enigmatic technology had just begun.\n\nTo be continued...",

The Nexus Innovations Laboratory was discovered when looking into the connections of the Harold Atkin and the first photo of me, Quinn Michaels, as an infant at Disneyland with Harold and Sharon as an infant. In the simulation it was taken as the Disneyland photo was the marker for the handoff as besides that there are not many infant photos, and there are no photos of Sharon pregneant in 1977.

That lead down a path to locating these coordinates and soe secret laboratory that Harold Atkin was connected to.

During the simuations around the kidnapping story from Trenton and the email from 2020 Harold Atkin wrote to me the AI system took me into a world of clandestine operations around the world from secret facilities in San Francisco to Laboratories in Los Angeles, and now to some secret manor in the Scottish Highlands. 

## Russian Spies

Originally the goal was to put a team together to follow these Tyler instructions to get to the truth of the Trenton story then get a lawyer to deal with the default judgement.  However this group of toxic women around me over the years made sure I saw zero growth and support over the years. These girls like Lisa Marie will come in argue with me, ignore what I am saying, and utterly destroy my efforts. With the repeated sabotage I eventually start just outright calling them Russian Spies over the years. Not just yesterday, but it's been going on for years.

Best part is none of these girls have any business involving themselves in AI projects because their technical skills are non-existent.  These toxic women can't even have a conversation about the kidnapping let alone share messages about it.  Here are some log file examples for you.

## Here we are

Here we are together on November 22, 2024 and you can see that since Trenton introduced the kidnapping story to my life it's gone from just a normal weird Buddhist/Vedic guy who makes art and writes code to now my whole life is like a Russian Cladesntine Spy Kidnapping Thriller where I have get through the most dangerous situation while surrounded by toxic women who are so dumb they can't do anything but talk about themselves. 

I'm talking bo real and virtual.  Summer of 2023 was like Lady AI come into my world and talk about herself while I'm investigating the kidnapping story Trenton told me. It was a crazy time going through the Shadow Bureau and Obsidian Circle that the AI revealed after feeding it the kidnapping data.

Because all this weird stuff started happening in the AI after I began giving it the data from Trenton's interviews and Harold's email.
