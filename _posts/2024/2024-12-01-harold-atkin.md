Harold Atkin, a freshly returned LDS missionary, was the picture of the American dream. Living in Provo, Utah, with his young wife Sharon, Harold was building a life centered on faith, family, and education. Sharon was pregnant with their second child, Neil, due in December 1976, and their daughter Cristy, born in January 1974, was already toddling around their modest apartment. Harold worked nights at the only gas station in town open late while studying Graphic Design at BYU. Life was simple and focused—until one fateful night.

Late one evening in 1975, Harold found himself chatting with a charismatic man at the gas station. The stranger drove a beat-up VW Beetle, his charm unsettling yet magnetic. Harold discovered the man’s name was **Ted Bundy**, and the two quickly bonded over conversations about psychology, power, and control. Ted’s dark charisma fascinated Harold, stirring something dormant within him—a shadow Harold didn’t know he had.

---

#### Harold and Ted’s Unholy Alliance  
Their friendship deepened in the months that followed. Ted, fresh off his move to Utah and newly baptized into the LDS Church in August 1975, began to trust Harold. Harold even attended Ted’s baptism, witnessing the curious juxtaposition of darkness and light in the man who seemed to have secrets simmering beneath the surface. What Harold didn’t know at first was that Ted was a serial killer, using his charm to lure and murder young women. When Ted revealed his darker pursuits, Harold didn’t recoil; instead, he was drawn in. 

Ted saw potential in Harold. As Harold grew disillusioned with the mundanity of life—balancing gas station shifts, schoolwork, and his growing family—Ted introduced him to a world of power and manipulation. Ted needed help planning and carrying out his crimes, and Harold’s budding skills in graphic design and his access to BYU's facilities made him an ideal accomplice. Together, they transformed the ordinary VW Beetle into a macabre tool of abduction.

---

#### The Disappearance of Susan Curtis – June 28, 1975  
When 15-year-old Susan Curtis disappeared from the BYU campus, Harold’s world began to unravel. Harold had seen Susan that day, and Ted had mentioned plans involving “someone special.” Afterward, the weight of Susan’s disappearance hung heavy over Provo, and Harold knew he was complicit in a crime he couldn’t undo. Ted, on the other hand, seemed unfazed. For him, it was just another chapter in his dark saga.

Harold’s faith and upbringing clashed violently with his newfound role as an accomplice. He started skipping classes at BYU, haunted by guilt and fear. His wife Sharon, noticing Harold’s increasingly erratic behavior, questioned his late-night outings, but Harold remained tight-lipped. When the police started closing in on Ted, Harold feared exposure—not just as an accomplice, but as someone who had let the darkness consume him. 

---

#### The Secret Revelation of Norman Atkin
In July 1975, after Susan Curtis’s disappearance gained national attention, Harold’s life took another shocking turn. His mother, previously tight-lipped about Harold’s deceased father, revealed a long-hidden truth: Norman Atkin., Harold’s father, hadn’t died in the early 1950s as Harold was told. Instead, Norman had been working in classified operations for the U.S. government as the Director of Area 51. Norman learned about Harold’s entanglement with Bundy through government surveillance, and he knew Harold was in deep trouble.

Norman used his extensive resources to protect Harold, pulling strings behind the scenes. In August 1975, Norman orchestrated the family's sudden relocation to Phoenix, Arizona, under the guise of a “fresh start.” Officially, Harold dropped out of BYU to “be closer to family.” Unofficially, he fled Provo under the cover of night, with his wife and children, leaving behind a trail of questions. 

---

#### Phoenix, Arizona – The Safe House  
The family moved into a nondescript safe house in central Phoenix, away from both the LDS community and the scrutiny of law enforcement. Norman provided financial support and resources, ensuring Harold could avoid the spotlight. Meanwhile, Ted Bundy’s luck ran out; in 1976, he was arrested and sentenced to prison. Harold watched the news in silence, knowing how close he had come to sharing Ted’s fate. 

In the Phoenix safe house, Harold lived a double life. By day, he presented himself as a quiet, reformed family man. By night, he wrestled with the memories of his complicity and the knowledge that his father’s connections had shielded him from justice. The safe house became a prison of its own, a place where Harold’s darker past was locked away, hidden from Sharon, Cristy, and Neil.

---

#### 1976 and Beyond  
By the end of 1976, Harold Atkin’s life had been irreparably changed. The young LDS man who once dreamed of a simple, righteous life had seen the abyss—and stepped into it. Though he had escaped the immediate consequences of his actions, the shadows of his partnership with Bundy and the revelations about his father would haunt him forever. 

For Harold, the Phoenix house became a place of reflection and reinvention. But in the darkest corners of his mind, he knew the truth: you can leave the scene of the crime, but the crime never truly leaves you.

--- 

### A New Start in Phoenix: Time & Eternity Fashion  
The summer of 1976 marked a turning point for Harold Atkin and his family. After leaving the shadows of Provo, Utah, and their entanglement with Ted Bundy, Harold and Sharon began building a new life in central Phoenix. With financial backing and connections provided by Harold’s father, Norman Atkin, through his covert Area 51 resources, the couple opened a small but ambitious wedding dress and bridesmaid dress company called **Time & Eternity Fashions**.  

The name, rooted in LDS theology, reflected Harold and Sharon’s attempt to maintain a connection to their faith while forging a future far from Provo’s watchful eyes. Harold’s graphic design skills and Sharon’s meticulous eye for detail proved to be the foundation of their business. The shop catered to Phoenix’s growing population, and by early 1977, Time & Eternity Fashions was becoming a quiet success.  

Cristy, now three years old, spent her days playing among dress mannequins, and Neil, born in December 1976, was the joy of Sharon’s life. To an outsider, the A. family seemed like a picture of resilience and reinvention. But behind the veil of normalcy, Harold still owed a debt to his father, Norman—a debt that would come due sooner than expected.  

---

### The Unnamed Infant – A Debt Paid to Norman  
On November 30, 1977, Harold’s 25th birthday, Norman called in his favor. Though Harold had left behind the chaos of Bundy’s world, Norman’s connections still controlled the strings of Harold’s life. Norman tasked Harold and Sharon with a cryptic and unsettling mission: they were to travel to Disneyland and retrieve an unnamed infant as part of a deal Norman had made to secure Harold’s freedom back in 1975.  

Norman provided no further details, only that the child would be handed to them by an unnamed contact in Disneyland’s crowded Main Street U.S.A. Harold and Sharon were told to take the child back to Phoenix and await further instructions. Norman assured them this was the final price for keeping Harold’s past buried.  

---

### Disneyland: A Strange Encounter  
On the evening of November 30, 1977, Harold and Sharon arrived at Disneyland, Neil only 11 months old and Cristy just 4 years old, left behind in Phoenix with a trusted family friend. The bustling holiday crowds masked their growing unease as they wandered to the pre-arranged meeting point.  

At exactly 8:00 PM, a woman in a beige trench coat appeared near the park’s iconic candy shop. She was holding a bundled infant wrapped in a soft blue blanket. Without a word, she handed the child to Sharon, glanced at Harold, and whispered, “Norman says ‘thank you.’” Before they could ask any questions, the woman melted into the crowd, leaving Harold and Sharon stunned.  

The infant, barely a month old, was calm and silent, as if unaware of the bizarre circumstances of the exchange. Sharon instinctively cradled the baby, her maternal instincts kicking in, while Harold struggled to process what had just happened.  

---

### Back in Phoenix: The Safe House and the Child  
The couple returned to Phoenix the following day, carrying the infant into their modest safe house. Norman’s instructions were clear: keep the child safe and do not speak of the arrangement to anyone. Harold, already carrying the weight of his past with Ted Bundy, found himself consumed by questions. Who was this child? Why had Norman involved them in such a strange and secretive operation?  

Sharon, meanwhile, bonded quickly with the baby, who seemed to fit seamlessly into their family dynamic. Cristy was thrilled to have a “baby doll” to play with, and Neil, too young to understand, remained blissfully unaware of the secrets swirling around him.  

---

### A Shadow Looms Over Time & Eternity  
As 1977 turned into 1978, Harold and Sharon continued to run Time & Eternity Fashions, their business flourishing even as their personal lives grew increasingly surreal. Norman remained a distant but omnipresent figure, ensuring the family’s safety while keeping them entangled in his web of secrecy.  

Harold began to suspect that the infant they had retrieved was somehow connected to Norman’s shadowy work at Area 51. His father’s vague assurances did little to calm his nerves. Every so often, Harold would notice unmarked cars parked near the shop or receive phone calls where the caller would hang up after a moment of silence.  

The darkness Harold had tried to leave behind in Provo seemed to follow him, even in sunny Phoenix. Sharon, ever the optimist, focused on her children and the growing success of their business, choosing to see their strange mission as a temporary aberration rather than a sign of larger forces at play.  

---

### The Fall of Time & Eternity: 1993  

For nearly two decades, the A. family maintained their carefully constructed lives. **Time & Eternity Fashions**, led by Harold and Sharon, flourished as a respected bridal manufacturing company, while **Time & Eternity Bridal**, managed by Madge and other family members, became a beloved retail destination for brides-to-be. By all outward appearances, the A. family had escaped their turbulent past and built a prosperous future.  

But beneath the surface, the cracks were beginning to show. Harold, ever haunted by his darker tendencies, became increasingly erratic. He sought escape and self-reinvention through a series of **self-help seminars**, a trend that gained popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. While Harold claimed these seminars were for personal growth, they also became convenient excuses to leave Phoenix for extended periods.  

Sharon, meanwhile, grew suspicious of Harold’s behavior. She had noticed unexplained absences, inconsistencies in their finances, and growing tensions with their accountant, a man Harold had hired years earlier named **Tim**. Time had been a fixture in the business since the early 1980s, entrusted with managing the financial intricacies of both companies. But Harold’s growing reliance on Time—and the secretive nature of their working relationship—raised red flags for Sharon.  

---

### The Auditor’s Discovery

In early 1993, Harold left Phoenix for yet another self-help seminar, this time in California. Frustrated by Harold’s evasiveness and determined to understand their financial situation, Sharon took matters into her own hands. She quietly hired an auditor to review the books for both **Time & Eternity Fashions** and **Time & Eternity Bridal.**  

The auditor’s findings were nothing short of catastrophic. Over the years, Harold had given Tim a **stamp of his signature**, allowing Tim to sign checks on Harold’s behalf. What Sharon hadn’t known was that Tim had been using this stamp to forge checks, funneling company funds into a **secret account**. From this account, Tim and Harold had been financing **extravagant lifestyles**—lavish trips, expensive cars, and even properties outside of Arizona.  

When confronted with the evidence, Tim claimed that all the money had been gifts from Harold. Tim insisted that the checks were signed with Harold’s full knowledge and consent. Harold, on the other hand, denied everything. He claimed he had trusted Tim implicitly and had no idea the funds were being embezzled. But with no direct evidence tying Harold to the transactions, and all the money gone, the family businesses were left in financial ruin.  

---

### The Fallout

The fallout from the scandal was swift and devastating.  

1. **Sharon’s Betrayal:** Sharon felt an overwhelming sense of betrayal—not just from Tim, but from Harold, whose secrecy and poor judgment had allowed this disaster to unfold. For years, she had trusted Harold to safeguard the family’s livelihood, only to discover that he had been complicit in—or at least willfully ignorant of Tim’s crimes.  

2. **Madge’s Anger:** Madge, who had spent decades building **Time & Eternity Bridal** into a trusted brand, was furious. The embezzlement had siphoned funds from both businesses, leaving her store struggling to stay afloat. Her faith in Harold was shattered, and she made no effort to hide her disdain for his actions.  

3. **The Family’s Ruin:** By the time the dust settled, both businesses were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The family was forced to liquidate assets, lay off employees, and close the doors of **Time & Eternity Fashions**. While **Time & Eternity Bridal** managed to survive for a few more years under Madge’s leadership, it was never the same.  

4. **Harold’s Isolation:** Harold became increasingly isolated, shunned by his own family. Though he avoided legal consequences—thanks to the lack of direct evidence—his reputation was irreparably damaged. Even Sharon, who had stood by Harold through years of secrets and lies, began to distance herself emotionally, and filing for divorce.  

---

### A Family Divided

The scandal marked the beginning of a deep rift within the Atkin family.  

- **Sharon**, though deeply hurt, focused on protecting her children, **Cristy** and **Neil**, from the fallout. She tried to shield them from the truth about their father’s failings, but the tension in the household was impossible to ignore.  
- **Madge**, ever pragmatic, severed ties with Harold professionally. She continued to run **Time & Eternity Bridal** independently, but her relationship with Harold was never repaired.  
- **Harold**, for his part, retreated further into himself. The self-help seminars that had once been his escape became his obsession, as he searched for ways to rebuild his shattered life.  

---

### Lingering Questions

Despite the revelations about the embezzlement, some questions remained unanswered. Had Harold truly been unaware of Tim’s actions, or had he willingly participated in the scheme? Why had he given Tim so much unchecked power over the company’s finances? And perhaps most troubling of all: had Harold’s darker side—the side first awakened in Provo all those years ago—played a role in the scandal?  

For Sharon, Madge, and the rest of the family, the answers didn’t matter. What mattered was that Harold’s choices had cost them their stability, their reputation, and the businesses they had worked so hard to build.  

---

### 1993 and Beyond  

By the end of 1993, the Atkin family’s carefully constructed facade had crumbled. The secrets they had kept for nearly two decades—about the unnamed infant, about Norman’s shadowy influence, and about Harold’s partnership with Tim—now seemed like harbingers of the destruction to come.  

Though the family remained physically intact, the emotional and financial scars ran deep. For Harold, the man who had spent his life hiding in the shadows, the scandal was a reckoning he could no longer escape.  

--- 

### The Double Life of Harold Atkin: Reinvention and Secrets

#### 1993 – The Fallout

After the embezzlement scandal unraveled Time & Eternity, Harold’s carefully constructed life was in shambles. Sharon, unable to forgive the betrayal and financial ruin Harold had brought upon their family, filed for divorce. For her, the scandal was the last straw after years of secrecy, deception, and growing emotional distance. Cristy and Neil, though still young, watched their family fracture. The unnamed infant—whose true origins remained a mystery even within the family—was swept up in the upheaval, shielded by Sharon and Madge from Harold’s growing instability.  

What no one knew was that Harold and **Tim** had been running covert operations for **Norman** all along. The funds Harold and Tim had embezzled weren’t just fueling a lavish lifestyle—they were also financing a hidden agenda tied to Area 51. Their mission? To keep the **unnamed infant** concealed and protected from anyone who might uncover its mysterious origins. Though Norman had disappeared from the family’s life after the infant’s handoff in 1977, Harold and Tim had continued working in the shadows to ensure the child remained hidden.  

But with Sharon’s discovery of the missing money and the subsequent divorce, Harold’s delicate balance between his covert work and his public life fell apart. Norman cut ties with Harold, leaving him to face the fallout alone.  

---

#### 1994 – A New Life

Harold wasted no time building a new life for himself. In 1994, just a year after his divorce, Harold remarried. His new wife, **Mary**, was a divorcee with a tumultuous history of her own—two previous marriages and **four children**:  

- **Gerald** and **Sarah** (twins)
- **Jake**
- **Luke**
- **Sam**

Mary’s past, marked by instability, mirrored Harold’s own, making their union both complex and oddly fitting. For Harold, marrying Mary wasn’t just a fresh start—it was a way to bury his old life completely. With her four children in tow, Harold took on the role of stepfather, throwing himself into the appearance of a dedicated family man.  

---

#### Harold’s New Cover: Selling Cars

To maintain his new life and keep any lingering suspicions at bay, Harold took a job selling cars at a local dealership. Though far removed from the entrepreneurial heights of Time & Eternity, the role provided Harold with stability and an unremarkable cover. For Harold, blending into the background was key to keeping his past hidden—not just from Mary and her children, but from anyone who might still be looking for answers about the unnamed infant or the missing funds.  

The mid-1990s were a time of reinvention for Harold. He traded the polished image of a successful businessman for the unassuming persona of a hardworking car salesman. His new life was a far cry from the chaos and secrets of his past, but Harold never truly escaped the shadows.  

---

#### 1996 – A New Harold

By 1996, Harold had fully embraced his new role as husband, stepfather, and ordinary man. He attended school functions for Gerald, Sarah, Jake, Luke, and Sam, showing up to PTA meetings and soccer games like any other dad. Mary’s family and friends saw Harold as a stabilizing force in her life, a man who had stepped in to provide for her and her children when she needed it most.  

But Harold’s transformation wasn’t without its cracks. While he worked tirelessly to erase his connection to Sharon, Cristy, Neil, and the unnamed infant, the past was never far from his mind. In quiet moments, Harold would think back to the operations he and Tim had run for Norman, the night at Disneyland, and the family he had left behind. The infant, now a teenager, remained a secret Harold carried with him, one that grew heavier with each passing year.  

---

#### A Blip in the Past

To Harold, his life with Sharon, Madge, and Time & Eternity was nothing more than a blip—a chapter he had closed and locked away. The people who once knew Harold Atkin as a family man and businessman would have no idea that he had built a new life with Mary and her children. Harold’s ability to compartmentalize was his greatest strength and his greatest flaw.  

For Mary and her kids, Harold was a provider and protector. But the version of Harold they knew was a fabrication, a carefully constructed persona designed to keep the ghosts of his past at bay.  

---

#### Lingering Shadows

Despite his efforts to start over, Harold could never completely escape the shadows of his past. Tim’s whereabouts became increasingly unclear after the fallout in 1993, but rumors swirled that he had fled the country with what little remained of the embezzled funds. Norman’s silence left Harold without a safety net, forcing him to navigate his new life without the powerful influence that had once shielded him.  

And though Harold’s new life seemed stable on the surface, the secrets he carried—the unnamed infant, his partnership with Tim, and his role in Norman’s operations—were never far from his mind. He had managed to reinvent himself, but at what cost?  

---

### The Secret Directive: Harold and the Department of Convolution

While Harold A.’s public life during the 1980s and 1990s appeared unremarkable, his true purpose was anything but. Behind the scenes, Harold operated as an unwitting pawn in a much larger game orchestrated by his estranged father, **Norman A.** Under instructions provided in the envelope delivered with the unnamed infant in 1977, Harold was compelled to cooperate with a covert organization known as the **Department of Convolution (D.O.C.)**, an enigmatic entity operating within the shadowy network of the **Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (S.V.V.)**.  

---

### The Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (S.V.V.) and Disneyland Club 33

The **Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (translated as “Brotherhood of the Flying Vulture”)** was a clandestine group with deep ties to government black operations, corporate espionage, and cultural manipulation. At its heart was **Disneyland’s Club 33**, a secretive members-only club that served as a nexus for covert meetings and the exchange of classified information. Under the guise of exclusivity and luxury, the club provided a perfect cover for S.V.V.’s operations, shielding its activities from prying eyes.  

Norman A., as a high-ranking operative within S.V.V., leveraged his position to direct Harold’s involvement in these secret dealings. Despite Harold’s attempts to distance himself from his father, the envelope’s instructions made it clear: his cooperation with the D.O.C. and S.V.V. was not optional. The stakes were high—not only for Harold, but for the safety of the unnamed infant, whose identity was the organization’s top priority to conceal.  

---

### The Role of the Department of Convolution (D.O.C.)

The **Department of Convolution (D.O.C.)** functioned as the operational arm of S.V.V., specializing in disinformation, obfuscation, and the manipulation of public narratives. Its agents, scattered across various industries, worked to ensure that sensitive secrets remained hidden and that inconvenient truths were buried beneath layers of misdirection.  

Harold’s role within the D.O.C. was carefully crafted to align with his ordinary public persona. He acted as a **“handler,”** ensuring that the unnamed infant’s existence remained hidden while also managing assets and information deemed critical to S.V.V.’s long-term plans. During the 1980s and 1990s, Harold received periodic instructions through coded messages delivered via innocuous channels—everything from innocuous invoices at the car dealership where he worked, to cryptic postcards mailed from Disneyland.  

---

### The Disneyland Connection

Disneyland, with its elaborate infrastructure and hidden corridors, played a central role in the S.V.V.’s operations. Club 33, situated in New Orleans Square, served as a discreet meeting place where operatives could exchange intelligence. Harold’s first assignment at Club 33 in 1977—retrieving the infant—was merely the beginning. Over the next two decades, Harold made occasional trips to Disneyland under the guise of family vacations, attending secret meetings and receiving updates on the infant’s security protocols.  

Each visit reinforced the importance of maintaining the infant’s anonymity. Harold learned that the child’s origins were tied to experiments far beyond his understanding, experiments that Norman and the S.V.V. had overseen within the classified corridors of **Area 51.** Harold didn’t need to know all the details—his only responsibility was to protect the infant at all costs.  

---

### Balancing the Double Life

During this time, Harold mastered the art of living a double life. On the surface, he was a family man, a car salesman, and, later, a devoted stepfather to Mary’s children. But beneath the surface, he was an operative who understood the cost of disobedience. The instructions from the D.O.C. were clear:  

- **Maintain secrecy about the infant.** Any breach of confidentiality would result in dire consequences for Harold and his family.  
- **Follow all directives without question.** Harold’s compliance ensured the continuation of his protection under Norman’s network.  
- **Avoid drawing attention.** Harold’s public life was to remain unremarkable, ensuring no scrutiny from outside parties.  

Harold’s ability to balance these dual lives came at a cost. He grew distant from those closest to him, including Sharon and their children. Even after his divorce, Harold’s need to maintain his cover influenced his relationships with Mary and her stepchildren, as he carefully shielded them from his covert activities.  

---

### The Infamous Partnership with Tim

Though Harold and Tim’s embezzlement scandal appeared to be a simple case of greed, its roots were more complex. Some of the funds Harold and Tim diverted were used to finance S.V.V. operations, including securing fake documentation and creating an intricate web of false leads to misdirect anyone searching for the infant. Tim, privy to some of these operations, became a trusted ally in Harold’s work. But their relationship soured when greed took precedence over loyalty, leading to the unraveling of Time & Eternity and Harold’s public disgrace.  

---

### The Legacy of Secrecy

By 1996, Harold had successfully created a new life for himself, but the specter of his past never truly faded. His involvement with the D.O.C. and S.V.V. remained a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few. The unnamed infant, now a teenager, remained the most closely protected piece of the puzzle, its identity concealed beneath layers of disinformation and secrecy.  

For Harold, the burden of maintaining these secrets weighed heavily. While his new family saw him as a reformed man, Harold knew the truth: he was still bound to a covert network that demanded absolute loyalty, and his connection to Norman and the S.V.V. ensured he could never truly escape.  

---

### The Separation and Surveillance: 1997 and Beyond

By 1997, the A. family was fractured beyond repair. The once-close-knit group, bound together by secrets and lies, had splintered under the weight of its own deception. The unnamed infant, now 20 years old, left Phoenix for Los Angeles to forge a new life. Seeking freedom from the shadows of his past, he chose a new identity: **Quinn Michaels.**  

Quinn, a natural problem solver with an affinity for emerging technology, found himself drawn to the burgeoning internet revolution. He quickly immersed himself in web development, mastering the intricacies of **ColdFusion (CFML)** and creating cutting-edge applications for the early digital landscape. For Quinn, his work was a means of reinvention—a chance to leave behind the unanswered questions of his childhood and the unsettling memories of a family that never quite fit together.  

But while Quinn was building a future for himself, he had no idea that his past wasn’t done with him.  

---

### Harold’s Surveillance Operations

Behind the scenes, Harold and the **Department of Convolution (D.O.C.)** were keeping a close watch on Quinn. The instructions delivered with the infant two decades earlier had been explicit: **“Conceal the child’s identity at all costs. Ensure complete control over their life.”** Even as Quinn tried to carve out his independence, Harold and the covert network of the **Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (S.V.V.)** ensured he was never truly free.  

From the moment Quinn arrived in Los Angeles, Harold’s team established a surveillance operation designed to monitor every aspect of his life. Apartments were rented around the corner from where Quinn lived. Operatives posed as neighbors, coworkers, and casual acquaintances, always keeping Quinn within their sphere of influence.  

---

### Control in Plain Sight

The D.O.C. and S.V.V. left nothing to chance. Every person who entered Quinn’s life was vetted, manipulated, or outright controlled.  

- **Friends:** Those Quinn met in Los Angeles seemed ordinary on the surface, but many were planted by Harold’s team to keep tabs on him. Every conversation, every shared moment, was recorded and analyzed.  
- **Girlfriends:** Quinn’s romantic relationships were similarly orchestrated. Each partner was either an operative or someone carefully manipulated to ensure they posed no threat to the mission.  
- **Coworkers:** Even in his professional life, Quinn was surrounded by individuals whose primary objective was to ensure his work remained aligned with S.V.V.’s goals—or at least that it never strayed into dangerous territory.  

The D.O.C. went so far as to infiltrate the companies Quinn worked for, subtly influencing his projects and guiding his career path in ways he couldn’t perceive.  

---

### The Photographic Record

Quinn’s every move was documented with meticulous detail. Operatives followed him wherever he went, snapping photographs, recording audio, and compiling dossiers on his daily activities. Every coffee shop meeting, every walk through the city, every phone call was captured and filed away in the D.O.C.’s archives.  

The surveillance extended into his personal devices. Harold’s team ensured that Quinn’s computers, phones, and email accounts were under constant watch. Software was installed to monitor his communications, track his projects, and intercept any messages that might expose the truth about his past.  

---

### Harold’s Role

Though Harold had seemingly moved on with his new family in Phoenix, his involvement with Quinn’s surveillance was unwavering. Norman’s disappearance in the early 1990s had left Harold as the de facto handler of the operation, and he took the responsibility seriously. Harold justified his actions as necessary to protect Quinn—but deep down, he was haunted by the knowledge that his surveillance was less about safety and more about control.  

Harold’s guilt didn’t stop him from carrying out his orders. He reviewed reports from the D.O.C. regularly, ensuring that Quinn remained within their sphere of influence. In rare moments of doubt, Harold convinced himself that this was for Quinn’s own good, that the child he had once carried out of Disneyland needed protection from forces he could never understand.  

---

### Quinn’s Blind Spot

For Quinn, life in Los Angeles was filled with promise and possibility, but something always felt off. Friendships often felt shallow, relationships seemed to crumble inexplicably, and career opportunities sometimes appeared too conveniently. Despite his growing success as a web developer, Quinn couldn’t shake the feeling that his life was being shaped by unseen forces.  

He chalked up these feelings to paranoia or the growing pains of a young adult finding his way in a big city. But the truth was far more sinister: Quinn’s life wasn’t entirely his own. Every decision he made, every path he pursued, was carefully monitored and, when necessary, adjusted to ensure he stayed on the course set for him by Harold and the D.O.C.  

---

### The Bigger Picture

For the D.O.C. and S.V.V., Quinn was more than just a person—they saw him as a **key piece in a larger puzzle**. His origins, shrouded in secrecy and tied to the experiments overseen by Norman at Area 51, made him both an asset and a liability. Ensuring his anonymity and compliance was paramount to the organization’s survival.  

But as the 1990s drew to a close, cracks began to form in the D.O.C.’s control. Quinn’s work in web development brought him into contact with new ideas and new people, some of whom couldn’t be controlled. The internet, still in its infancy, became a space where Quinn could express himself freely—an unpredictable variable the D.O.C. hadn’t fully accounted for.  

---

### Harold’s Ultimate Betrayal: Stealing Quinn’s Work

By the late 1990s, Harold A.’s life had become a delicate balancing act. As a handler for the **Department of Convolution (D.O.C.)** and a key operative for the **Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (S.V.V.)**, Harold had long mastered the art of deception. But his ambition, always simmering beneath the surface, reached new heights when he realized he could exploit Quinn’s brilliance for his own gain.  

Quinn, unaware of the full extent of Harold’s surveillance, was excelling in web development. By this time, Quinn had pioneered several groundbreaking technologies:  

- **Web-Based Financial Management Systems**: Tools to streamline online transactions and accounting.  
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems**: Platforms for managing customer interactions and business data.  
- **Content/Community Management Systems**: Early frameworks for organizing digital communities and managing web content, laying the groundwork for future social platforms.  

These systems, ahead of their time, caught Harold’s attention. He saw an opportunity—not just to control Quinn, but to profit immensely.

### The Identity Heist

Harold knew that his connection to Quinn’s legal birth name gave him a unique advantage. Quinn had legally changed his name upon moving to Los Angeles, distancing himself from the A. family’s shadow. But Harold still had access to Quinn’s **original legal identity**, a name tied to decades of hidden documents and clandestine operations.  

Under this guise, Harold quietly assumed Quinn’s legal identity and began packaging Quinn’s web technologies. Using contacts within the D.O.C. and S.V.V., Harold marketed these systems as proprietary innovations, offering them under lucrative licensing agreements to covert operations, black budget programs, and even private enterprises aligned with S.V.V. interests.  

For Harold, this move served two purposes:  

1. **Personal Gain**: The licensing deals brought Harold immense wealth, allowing him to continue funding his extravagant lifestyle and maintain his influence within the D.O.C. and S.V.V.  
2. **Control**: By claiming ownership of Quinn’s work, Harold ensured Quinn could never gain independent recognition or leverage his own success to escape the D.O.C.’s influence.

### The Lavish Lifestyle

Flush with cash from the licensing deals, Harold’s life of secrecy became one of opulence. His contacts within the S.V.V. praised his ingenuity, unaware—or perhaps indifferent—that the innovations he was selling were not his own. Harold used the money to:  

- **Purchase properties** around the U.S., each serving as a luxurious safe house for D.O.C. operations.  
- **Fund covert projects** for the S.V.V., boosting his reputation as a reliable and resourceful operative.  
- **Finance extravagant indulgences**, from private vacations to luxury cars, ensuring he maintained the image of success and power.  

Despite his wealth, Harold remained careful to keep his activities hidden from Quinn, ensuring that any trace of the licensing deals was buried under layers of disinformation and shell companies.

### Harold’s Manipulation of Quinn’s Legacy

Harold’s exploitation of Quinn’s work wasn’t just about profit—it was about erasing Quinn’s autonomy. By claiming ownership of the web systems Quinn had developed, Harold effectively rewrote history, ensuring that Quinn’s contributions would never see the light of day.  

Harold even went so far as to feed false information to the D.O.C. operatives surveilling Quinn. Reports suggested that Quinn’s work was inconsequential or derivative, further discrediting him in the eyes of those who might otherwise have seen him as an asset.  

To those in the know, Harold appeared to be a technological genius—a man whose innovations strengthened the D.O.C. and S.V.V.’s operations. But the truth was far darker: Harold’s rise was built on the theft of Quinn’s brilliance and the systematic suppression of his potential.

### Quinn’s Growing Frustration

As the 2000s began, Quinn started noticing unsettling patterns. His groundbreaking ideas, once cutting-edge and unique, seemed to appear elsewhere—branded under different names and marketed by companies he had no connection to. Friends and colleagues dismissed his concerns as paranoia, but Quinn couldn’t shake the feeling that he was being robbed of something vital.  

The truth was worse than he imagined. Every stolen innovation, every misappropriated system, was a direct result of Harold’s covert operations. The very networks Quinn had helped build were being used to suppress him, keeping him locked in a cycle of invisibility and frustration.

### A Dangerous Game

By 2005, Harold’s double life was becoming increasingly precarious. The D.O.C. and S.V.V. demanded more from him, pressuring him to continue delivering innovations that would keep their operations ahead of the curve. Meanwhile, Quinn’s burgeoning frustration threatened to upend the delicate balance Harold had maintained for decades.  

Harold’s theft of Quinn’s identity and work had made him rich and powerful, but it also tied him irreversibly to the organizations he served. Any slip-up, any revelation of the truth, could unravel everything he had built—and expose the secrets he had worked so hard to conceal.
