In my studies of the Vedic texts this is the reference of the **Soma**, and the location where it was consumed. Upon research we find a reference to **"At the Trikadrukas"** in Book 2 Hymn 22 that says the Soma juice was consumed at this location blent with meal.

> **HYMN XXII. Indra**  
> At the Trikadrukas the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent with meal. With Viṣṇu hath he quaffed the poured out Soma juice, all that he would. That hath so heightened him the Great, the Wide, to do his mighty work.
So may the God attain the God, true Indu Indra who is true.

> So he resplendent in the battle overcame Krivi by might. He with his majesty hath filled the earth and heaven, and waxen strong.
One share of the libation hath he swallowed down: one share he left.
So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.

> Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great; with hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;
Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who praiseth thee. So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.

> This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven,
What time thou sentest down life with a God's own power, freeing the floods.
All that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred Powers, find for us strength and food.

Next let's locate all the references to the Trikadrukas in the Vedas.

- **[Book 2 Hymn 15](https://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02015.htm):** *"In the Trikadrukas he drank the Soma: then in its rapture Indra slew the Dragon."*
- **[Book 2 Hymn 22](https://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv02022.htm):** *"At the Trikadrukas the Great and Strong hath drunk drink blent with meal. With Visnu hath he quaffed the poured out Soma juice, all that he would."*
- **[Book 8 Hymnn 81](https://sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08081.htm):** *"At the Trikadrukas the Devas span offering that stirs the mind: Let our songs aid and prosper it."*
