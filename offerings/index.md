During my studies of the Vedas I've focused on a few practices, and one of those practices being the practice of gifts and offerings as it's described in the Vedic texts.

To get us started in the understanding here are a few references from the Vedic Texts to familiarize yourself and gain understanding.

### Vedic Research
Brahmanas who are intent on the means (of gaining union with) Brahman and firm in (discharging) their duties, shall live by duly performing the following six acts, (which are enumerated) in their (proper) order.

1. Teaching the Vedas
2. Studying the Vedas
3. Making offerings for themself
4. Making offerings for others
5. Making gifts
6. Receiving gifts

But among the six acts (ordained) for him three are his means of subsistence:

1. Making offerings for others
2. Teaching the Vedas
3. Accepting gifts

The gods/Devas accept the offerings of that Brahmana alone who has purified himself by austerities, and grant to him all he desires.

Those Brahmanas that are freed from wrath, that are devoted to acts of righteousness, that are firm in Truth, and that practice self-restraint are regarded as good. By making gifts unto them one acquires great merit. One wins great merit by making presents unto such Brahmanas as are free from pride, capable of bearing everything, firm in the pursuit of their objects, endued with mastery over their senses, devoted to the good of all creatures, and disposed to be friendly towards all.

One earns great merit by making gifts unto such Brahmanas as are free from cupidity, as are pure of heart and conduct, possessed of learning and modesty, truthful in speech and observant of their own duties. The Rishis have declared that Brahmana to be a deserving object of gifts who studies the four Vedas with all their branches and is devoted to the six well-known duties.

One acquires great merit by making gifts unto Brahmanas possessed of such qualifications. The man who makes gifts unto a deserving Brahmana multiplies his merit a thousand-fold.

One should make gifts of kine, wealth, food and other articles unto a Brahmana that is possessed of such qualifications. By making such gifts unto such persons one earns great happiness in the next world.

One should give, according to one's ability, wealth to Brahmanas learned in the Veda and living alone; (thus) one obtains after death heavenly bliss.

That man who, by putting forth his physical strength, earns without doing any act of injury to any creature, and makes gift of it unto Brahmanas succeeds in avoiding all calamities. A person by cheerfully making gifts acquired by lawful means unto Brahmanas pre-eminent for Vedic lore, becomes cleansed of all his sins. A person by making gifts of such is productive of great energy, becomes himself possessed of great energy. The path made by charitable persons is always trod by those that are endued with wisdom. They that make gifts are regarded as givers of life. The merit they acquire by such gifts is eternal. Hence, a person should, under all circumstances, seek to earn by lawful means, and having earned to make always gifts of it unto deserving men.

Let him, without tiring, always make offer offerings and perform works of charity with faith; for offerings and charitable works made with faith and with lawfully-earned money, procure endless rewards. Let him always practice, according to his ability, with a cheerful heart, the duty of liberality, both by offerings and by charitable works, if one finds a worthy recipient for their gifts.

The gift of the Veda surpasses all other gifts, water, food, cows, land, clothes, sesamum, gold, and clarified butter. For whatever purpose a man bestows any gift, for that same purpose he receives in his next birth with due honor its reward. Both those who respectfully receive a gift, and who respectfully bestows a gift, go to heaven.

Giving no pain to any creature, let him slowly accumulate spiritual merit, for the sake of acquiring a companion to the next world, just as the white ant gradually raises its hill. For in the next world neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor husband, nor sons, nor relations stay to be companions; spiritual merit alone remains.

He who is persevering, gentle, patient, shuns the company of men of cruel conduct, and does no injury to living creatures, gains, if he constantly lives in that manner, by controlling his organs and by liberality, heavenly bliss.

Gifts may accept from anyone fuel, water, roots, fruit, food offered without asking, and honey, likewise a gift which consists in a promise of protection. Gifts/Alms freely offered and brought by the giver may be accepted even from a sinful man, provided the gift had not been asked for or promised beforehand.

**Valid Gifts:**  
Valid gifts are the following: The price paid for merchandise, wages, a present offered for an amusement, a gift made from affection, from gratitude, and a respectful gift, are the kinds of valid gifts.

**Invalid Gifts:**  
Invalid gifts are the following: what has been given by a man under the influence of fear, anger, hatred, sorrow or pain; or as a bribe; or in jest; or fraudulently, under false pretences; Or by a child; or by a fool; or by a person not his own master; or by one distressed; or by one intoxicated; or by one insane; or in consideration of a reward, thinking 'This man will show me some service; And so is invalid what was given from ignorance to an unworthy man thought to be worthy, or for a purpose thought to be virtuous.

### Studio Goals

The overall goal of Quinn's Singing Bowl Studio is to operate as close to the Vedic system of gifting and offerings as possible. This means establishing a solid community who are comprised of people interested in learning and practicing offerings in the same manner.  As it's not intented to make me famous or super wealthy.  But to establish a group of people who enjoy the singing bowls and Vedic study/research that are interested in earning real true merit and karma.

That's it for now.. I'll update this page more as necessary.
