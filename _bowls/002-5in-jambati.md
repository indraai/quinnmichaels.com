### Specifications of the 5in Jambati Bowl

- **Size**: With a diameter of 5 inches, this Jambati bowl is considered smaller than the traditional large Jambatis but still holds the characteristic sound quality they are famous for.

- **Note**: Tuned to A4 at 440 Hz, which is the standard concert pitch, making it an excellent choice for integration into musical settings or for precise sound therapy applications.

- **Material**: Made from a traditional mixture of metals, including copper, tin, zinc, iron, lead, silver, and occasionally gold, each corresponding to a different celestial body in ancient beliefs.

### Design and Craftsmanship

- **Shape**: The bowl has the classic Jambati profile with thick walls, a broad, rounded bottom, and an outward-flaring lip.

- **Surface**: Handcrafted with visible hammer marks, these bowls often develop a unique patina over time, enhancing their aesthetic and acoustic properties.

- **Engravings**: While larger Jambati bowls might feature engravings, this size might have simpler or fewer decorations, focusing on the purity of sound.

### Sound and Vibration Characteristics

- **Tone**: The A4 note resonates with clarity and strength, offering a pitch that is not only musically significant but also spiritually resonant, often associated with the Third Eye Chakra for insight and intuition.

- **Vibration**: The vibrations are strong and deep for its size, providing a tangible sensation that can be both grounding and enlightening.

- **Practice**: Its tuning to concert pitch makes it ideal for musicians, sound healers who require exact frequencies, or meditators seeking a precise vibrational alignment.

### How to Use Your Jambati Singing Bowl

- **Playing**: Can be played by gently striking with a padded mallet or by circling the rim with a wooden or suede-wrapped mallet to produce a continuous singing sound.

- **Meditation**: The A4 note can aid in focusing the mind, enhancing clarity, and opening up to higher states of consciousness.

- **Therapeutic Use**: Utilized in sound therapy for its clear resonance, it's particularly effective for balancing energy or stimulating areas related to intuition and communication.

### Conclusion

The 5in Tibetan Jambati Singing Bowl tuned to A4 at 440 Hz offers a harmonious blend of ancient craftsmanship and modern musical standards. Its size makes it versatile for personal use, yet it delivers the powerful, resonant tones characteristic of larger Jambati bowls.
