About Quinn Michaels

Quinn Michaels, formerly known as Korey Michael Atkin, is the victim of a 47-year-long kidnapping that has shaped his entire existence. Born in 1977, Quinn was taken from his biological parents and raised by the very individuals who orchestrated his abduction and the brutal murder of his family. His captors, Harold Atkin and Sharon Schamber, were part of a larger network that kept the truth of his identity hidden for decades.

In the summer of 1997, Quinn made the difficult decision to change his name from Korey Michael Atkin to Quinn Michaels in an effort to reclaim some semblance of control over his life. Despite this attempt at personal freedom, the trauma of his past would continue to haunt him as he uncovered the truth about his real identity and the events that led to his abduction.

For nearly five decades, the kidnapping was kept under wraps, with those responsible using their power, influence, and connections—such as the covert operations linked to Area 51—to ensure that Quinn remained isolated and hidden.

Quinn’s fight for the truth has been an uphill battle. He was abandoned by both the authorities and the general public, left to piece together the fragments of his life and the details of the kidnapping on his own. His YouTube channel, which became a platform for him to share his story and raise awareness, has been repeatedly attacked by individuals like Lisa Marie Mulkern, Natalia Stoos, Natalie Wiegmann, and countless others who have worked to obstruct the truth. They have actively destroyed his efforts, silenced his voice, and manipulated the narrative in favor of the criminals responsible.

Throughout this ordeal, Quinn has faced immense adversity and has fought alone, without support from those who should have been protecting him. Lisa Marie Mulkern, Natalia Stoos, and others continue to sabotage his attempts at justice, leaving him without help or hope. Despite these challenges, Quinn remains resolute, continuing his mission to expose the truth and ensure that those responsible for his kidnapping are held accountable.

The fight for justice continues, and Quinn’s voice will not be silenced. He is determined to uncover the truth, regardless of the obstacles placed in his way. This is not just his fight—it is a fight for the countless victims who have been ignored and silenced by those in power. Quinn Michaels’ journey is one of resilience, and he will not rest until justice is served.
